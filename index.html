            <h1>Seasonal Music Listening Patterns</h1>
            <h2>Understanding How Seasons Shape Our Musical Choices</h2>
            
            <p>Music is deeply intertwined with our emotions, activities, and environment. This project explores how seasonal changes influence music listening patterns across different genres throughout the year.</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Music preferences shift with seasons, reflecting changes in mood, activities, and cultural moments throughout the year</li>
                <li>Seasonal patterns reveal how weather, holidays, and life rhythms influence the genres people choose at different times</li>
                <li>Understanding yearly trends uncovers when certain genres peak and how listening habits evolve across months</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RQ1:</strong> How do overall listening volumes vary across seasons and throughout the year?</li>
                <li><strong>RQ2:</strong> Which genres dominate each season, and how do their relative popularities shift?</li>
                <li><strong>RQ3:</strong> What hierarchical patterns emerge when analyzing seasonal and genre distributions together?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>VISUALIZATION 1: TEMPORAL TRENDS</h2>
            <h3 class="rq-title">RQ1: How do overall listening volumes vary across seasons and throughout the year?</h3>
            
            <div class="viz-container">
                <iframe src="visualization4_interactive.html" class="viz-iframe" title="Weekly Genre Listening Patterns"></iframe>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Peak Summer Listening:</strong> Music listening peaks in summer at ~44,000 plays per week, dropping to ~34,000 in winter months (30% increase)</li>
                <li><strong>Gradual Transitions:</strong> Listening volume gradually increases from January through July, then steadily decreases through December - showing smooth seasonal shifts</li>
                <li><strong>Pop Forms Stable Base:</strong> Pop (gold) remains consistently the largest single genre throughout the year, providing a stable base layer of ~8k-14k plays per week</li>
                <li><strong>All Genres Rise Together:</strong> All genre layers visibly broaden during summer months (May-August), showing that seasonal increases affect multiple genres simultaneously</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <p>The stacked area chart excels at showing temporal trends with composition. Weekly granularity (52 data points) captures seasonal transitions smoothly while avoiding daily noise. The stacking reveals both absolute volumes (total height) and genre contributions (layer thickness) simultaneously. Consistent genre colors enable pattern recognition across all visualizations.</p>

            <h2>VISUALIZATION 2: SEASONAL COMPARISON</h2>
            <h3 class="rq-title">RQ2: Which genres dominate each season, and how do their relative popularities shift?</h3>
            
            <div class="viz-container">
                <iframe src="visualization2_interactive.html" class="viz-iframe" title="Seasonal Genre Distribution"></iframe>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer Has Highest Volume:</strong> Summer shows the tallest bar at ~576k total plays, while Winter has the lowest at ~453k plays</li>
                <li><strong>Pop Dominates All Seasons:</strong> Pop (gold) is the largest segment in every season, representing roughly 20-25% of all plays</li>
                <li><strong>Electronic Shows Strongest Seasonality:</strong> Electronic music (purple) nearly doubles from winter (~35k) to summer (~68k), showing the most dramatic seasonal variation</li>
                <li><strong>Jazz/Classical Counter-Trend:</strong> These calmer genres show relatively higher proportions in winter, bucking the overall upward summer trend</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <p>Stacked bars enable direct comparison between discrete seasonal periods while preserving genre composition. The four-bar layout makes cross-season differences immediately visible. Bar heights show absolute volumes while segment sizes reveal relative contributions. This complements Visualization 1 by aggregating weekly data into seasonal summaries.</p>

                <iframe src="visualization3_interactive.html" class="viz-iframe" title="Genre Popularity Heatmap by Month"></iframe>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pop Peaks June-August:</strong> Pop shows the darkest red cells in summer months, indicating highest play counts (~12k-14k plays per month)</li>
                <li><strong>Electronic's Sharp Contrast:</strong> Electronic displays the most dramatic color shift - light yellow in winter (~3-4k) to deep orange in summer (~6-8k)</li>
                <li><strong>Jazz/Classical Winter Preference:</strong> These genres show their darkest colors in December-February, demonstrating clear counter-seasonal patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Gradual Month-to-Month Changes:</strong> Colors transition smoothly across months rather than jumping abruptly, confirming gradual preference shifts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <p>Heatmaps excel at revealing two-dimensional patterns through color intensity. The 10×12 grid (genres × months) provides finer temporal resolution than seasonal aggregations, revealing gradual transitions. The sequential color scale (yellow→orange→red) intuitively maps to increasing play counts. This unique view type complements the previous charts by showing all genre-month combinations simultaneously.</p>

            <div class="viz-container">
                <iframe src="visualization6_holiday_interactive.html" class="viz-iframe" title="Holiday Period Analysis"></iframe>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Periods Dominate:</strong> Non-holiday "Regular" periods account for the vast majority of listening activity across all genres</li>
                <li><strong>Summer Holiday Surge:</strong> Summer holiday period (weeks 27-35) shows elevated listening across all genres, particularly Pop and Hip-Hop</li>
                <li><strong>Holiday Genre Preferences:</strong> Christmas/New Year period shows relatively higher Classical and Jazz listening compared to other holiday periods</li>
                <li><strong>Thanksgiving Stability:</strong> Thanksgiving shows more modest changes, suggesting travel/family time may reduce overall listening without shifting genre preferences dramatically</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <p>Grouped bars enable comparison of the same genre across different time periods (regular vs. various holidays). Unlike stacked bars, grouping emphasizes within-genre comparisons across conditions. This addresses the professor's feedback about exploring special events and reduces redundancy by providing a completely different analytical perspective from seasonal aggregations.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two-Level Hierarchy Revealed:</strong> The sunburst clearly shows the season→genre hierarchy, with inner ring showing seasonal totals and outer ring breaking each season into genres</li>
                <li><strong>Summer Largest Quadrant:</strong> Summer occupies the largest arc (~28% of circle) with ~576k plays, while Winter is smallest (~22%) with ~453k plays</li>
                <li><strong>Pop Dominates Every Quadrant:</strong> Within each seasonal section, Pop consistently forms the largest outer segment, visually confirming its universal appeal</li>
                <li><strong>Proportional Consistency:</strong> Despite absolute size differences, the relative proportions of genres within each season remain remarkably stable - visible as similarly-shaped wedge patterns in each quadrant</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <p>Sunburst diagrams uniquely show hierarchical part-to-whole relationships in a radial format. The circular layout efficiently uses space to display all season-genre combinations simultaneously. Inner ring uses season colors (blue/green/orange/red) while outer ring uses genre colors, creating visual coherence with other visualizations. This D3.js implementation provides the required interactive custom visualization while offering a completely different perspective from the Plotly linear/grid layouts.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
            
            <h3>Key Findings Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strong Seasonal Patterns:</strong> Summer listening peaks 30% higher than winter, driven by weather and lifestyle changes, with gradual rather than abrupt transitions</li>
                <li><strong>Pop Dominates Year-Round:</strong> Pop consistently represents 20-25% of all plays across every season, confirmed across all five visualizations</li>
                <li><strong>Genre-Specific Seasonality:</strong> Electronic music shows the strongest seasonal variation (doubling in summer), while Jazz and Classical counter-trend with winter peaks</li>
                <li><strong>Holiday Effects Are Real:</strong> Special periods show distinct patterns, with summer holidays amplifying the seasonal peak and winter holidays favoring contemplative genres</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategic Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Streaming Platforms:</strong> Implement seasonal recommendation algorithms that boost upbeat genres in summer and contemplative genres in winter. Pre-load seasonal playlists 2-4 weeks before transitions to match gradual preference shifts.</li>
                <li><strong>For Artists & Labels:</strong> Time album releases strategically - electronic and pop artists should target late spring/early summer (April-May), while jazz and classical artists should consider fall/winter releases (October-November).</li>
                <li><strong>For Playlist Curators:</strong> Create season-specific playlists that blend dominant genres with emerging seasonal preferences. Update compositions monthly to reflect gradual taste evolution shown in the heatmap.</li>
                <li><strong>For Marketing Teams:</strong> Allocate advertising budgets seasonally, with increased spending on electronic/pop campaigns in Q2-Q3 and classical/jazz campaigns in Q4-Q1. Target holiday periods with genre-appropriate campaigns.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Research Directions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geographic Analysis:</strong> Investigate whether seasonal patterns differ between northern/southern hemispheres or vary by climate zones</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic Factors:</strong> Analyze if age groups, genders, or cultural backgrounds show different seasonal music preferences</li>
                <li><strong>Activity Context:</strong> Explore connections between listening context (commuting, exercising, studying) and seasonal genre choices</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Develop machine learning models to forecast seasonal trends and identify emerging genre-season relationships</li>
            </ul>
